------------------------------------------------------------
GoWiki is a simple file based web application written in Go.
It can display, edit, and save content entered in simple
REST web-service fashion.  Page content is saved to the
file system as text documents, and pages are rendered
using the Go HTML templates package.  This application
is a sample based off the Go Programming Language tutorial
for writing web applications available at:
